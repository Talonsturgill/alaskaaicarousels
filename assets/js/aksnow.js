/* aksnow.js — carved snow surfaces (sastrugi) and two-part contact shadows.
 * Offline, deterministic per seed, ZERO dependencies beyond the committed
 * noise.js. Canvas 2D only.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Artwork craft has been the weakest rubric criterion in 9 of
 * the first 11 scored runs. Run 2026-07-30 attacked it by trading one precisely
 * modelled hero object for nine composed fields, and half of that worked: the
 * single-value-group defect that produced three consecutive 6.90 decks is
 * measurably dead (the shipped cover falls L 0.475 at the lit crest to L 0.120
 * at the near edge, with 2.9 percent of pixels within 0.03 of the mid band
 * against a 12 percent ceiling).
 *
 * The half that did NOT work is the reason for this file. "Distribute the
 * detail" is a plan, not a technique, and a plan with no per-region budget gets
 * spent on whatever is cheapest to draw everywhere. What that produced was a
 * UNIFORM-WEIGHT CONTOUR HATCH repeated across six slides, which four
 * independent pixel critics and the scorer all read the same way: not as
 * wind-carved snow but as topographic contour lines laid over a vertical
 * gradient, with "no visible fall-line spacing variation, no two-part contact
 * shadow, and no specular crest anywhere". The scorer's one-sentence fix was to
 * build ONE real surface properly and reuse it, which is what this is.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES SNOW READ AS CARVED RATHER THAN AS CONTOURS. Three things, and the
 * old hatch had none of them:
 *
 *   1. A RIDGE HAS TWO EDGES, NOT ONE. Real sastrugi are erosional forms with a
 *      steep windward face and a soft lee slope. Drawn as a single stroke a
 *      ridge is a line; drawn as a bright windward edge with a dark lee shadow
 *      immediately beneath it, the same geometry becomes a form with a light
 *      side and a dark side. This is the single highest-value difference and it
 *      costs one extra stroke.
 *   2. WEIGHT VARIES ALONG A RIDGE AND WITH DEPTH. A constant lineWidth reads as
 *      a drawn line at any density. Each ridge here tapers along its own length
 *      (hairline at the ends, full weight through the middle third) and scales
 *      with distance, so the near field carries visibly heavier marks than the
 *      far field. Line-weight VARIANCE is what the eye reads as texture.
 *   3. CRESTS CATCH THE LIGHT. Wind-polished snow throws small specular glints
 *      where a crest tangent turns across the key. A few dozen sub-pixel-ish
 *      points at the top of the value range do more for "this is snow" than
 *      hundreds more contour lines.
 *
 * ORDER-INDEPENDENT VALUE LADDER. The bands here are drawn as STRIPS between
 * adjacent contours, not as fills that run from each contour to the frame
 * bottom. That is deliberate. The fill-to-bottom form is order-dependent: run
 * the loop dark-to-light and the last, lightest band paints over every band
 * behind it and the whole mass flattens to one value with no error and a clean
 * machine gate. That is exactly the bug that shipped in run 2026-07-30's first
 * pass and it cost a render round to find. Strips cannot express it.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/noise.js"></script>
 *   <script src="@@ASSETS@@/js/aksnow.js"></script>
 *
 *   const stats = AKSNOW.surface(cx, {
 *     top: gx => 1000 + 30 * AK.fbm2(gx * 0.0022, 7.1, {octaves: 5}),
 *     bottom: 1350, x0: 0, x1: 1080,
 *     lit: "#C9DCF0", shadow: "#16283F",
 *     seed: 20260730, lightDeg: 118, windDeg: 200,
 *   });
 *   AKSNOW.contactShadow(cx, {x: 540, y: 1010, w: 90, color: "#101F33"});
 *
 * surface() returns {bands, ridges, weightMin, weightMax, weightVar, speculars}
 * so a caller or a test can assert the marks are not uniform. A test that only
 * asserts "something was drawn" would have passed the defect this file exists
 * to remove.
 *
 * HOUSE RULES THIS RESPECTS. Shadows are never black; contactShadow refuses a
 * pure-black colour. Shades ART only, never type. Everything is seeded, so the
 * same dossier reproduces the same pixels.
