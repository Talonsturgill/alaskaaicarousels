/* akengrave.js — WHITE-LINE INTAGLIO, the engraving bench.  (Alaska.Ai)
 * Committed 2026-07-31 for Carousel No. 21.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. One surface that carries modelled tone with genuine detail
 * everywhere, instead of a uniform hatch. It is the line-engraver's vocabulary
 * implemented as code, and it exists because "distribute the detail" turned out
 * to be a plan and not a technique (FIELD_NOTES 2026-07-30, No. 20's retro,
 * artwork craft 6.0 for the fourth time in five runs).
 *
 * WHITE LINE, NOT BLACK LINE. A black-line engraving on paper is a LIGHT deck,
 * and the one-light-deck-per-eight-runs allowance was spent on 2026-07-25.
 * White-line, where the cut prints LIGHT against a solid inked field, is the
 * dark register's native form of the same craft. That is why every stroke here
 * is drawn in a light ink over a dark ground.
 *
 * THE FOUR RULES IT IMPLEMENTS (FIELD_NOTES 2026-07-31, from RISD's "The
 * Brilliant Line", the Met's printmaking notes and the Library Company's
 * banknote-engraving material):
 *
 *   1. THE LAY WRAPS THE FORM. Hatching direction follows the surface it
 *      describes, so the DIRECTION FIELD is the modelling, before any value is
 *      applied. A hatch whose direction is constant across a frame is
 *      decoration. This is exactly what No. 20's uniform contour drift got
 *      wrong.
 *   2. THE SWELLED LINE. A stroke tapers at both ends and widens in the middle,
 *      and crossed swelled lines form lozenges that carry tone by themselves.
 *      Line-weight variance IS the technique, not a garnish on it.
 *   3. THREE PARTS, SEPARATELY CONTROLLABLE. mainline, crossline, interdot.
 *      Tone is the RELATIONSHIP between a dominant lay, a crossing lay, and the
 *      dots that sit in the diamonds.
 *   4. WHAT SETS A LINE'S THICKNESS IS THE LIGHT. Thickness is a lighting
 *      decision made per stroke, not a global stroke weight.
 *
 * WHY RULE 3 MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS. Three independently gated channels are
 * a PER-REGION DETAIL BUDGET EXPRESSED AS A DRAWING SYSTEM. "Everywhere" is not
 * an argument this function accepts. A budget with no line that reads "not here"
 * is not a budget, and that is the whole diagnosis from No. 20.

 *   eng.reserve(AKENGRAVE.boxesFor("[data-reserve]"));

 *     region: [80, 300, 920, 600],
 *     form:  (x, y) => <height in px>,
 *     tone:  (x, y) => <0..1 darkness target>,

 *     seedDeg: 0            // OPTIONAL, see LAY_ALIGN_WARN below
 *   });
 *
 * PERFORMANCE, THE LESSON THAT WILL BITE OTHERWISE. `cx.filter` applies PER DRAW
 * OP. A surface of ~1,300 strokes drawn under a set filter blurs 1,300 times and
 * blew the 45s navigation budget on 2026-07-30. Nothing in this file ever sets
 * cx.filter inside a stroke loop. Blur once, at composite, on an offscreen
 * canvas, which is what drawOffscreen() is for.
 *
 * COLOUR SAFETY. Every colour here is resolved through an integer-indexed ramp
 * or AKC.mixOklab. NO COLOUR HELPER IS EVER NESTED INSIDE ANOTHER, because
 * lerpHex and its cousins return an "rgb()" string, feeding rgb(...) into a hex
 * parser yields NaN on every channel, and canvas then silently keeps the
 * PREVIOUS fillStyle with a clean machine gate (instinct 0.97, run 2026-07-30).

  /* THE LAY THAT COLLAPSES ONTO ONE ISO-LINE (2026-09-03, run No.49).
   * Every stroke of a pass is seeded on a raster line through the region's
   * centre and then WALKS the direction field. When that raster runs PARALLEL
   * to the field, every seed sits on the SAME iso-line and all ~200 strokes
   * retrace one curve: the region prints as a single knotted swelled ribbon
   * with nothing modelled around it. Run No.49 shipped four independent
   * instances of it in one deck (slides 01, 06, 08, 09) and diagnosed them
   * four separate times, because nothing in this file says a word about it.
   *
   * A form that varies in ONE AXIS ONLY is the way in. Its gradient is
   * parallel everywhere, so its iso-lines are parallel straight lines, and
   * for a fall along x those lines are vertical, which is exactly the
   * direction the seed raster runs. Note that `angOff` cannot rescue it:
   * the raster is angOff + 90deg and the walk is isoAngle + angOff, so both
   * rotate together and the alignment is INVARIANT under angOff. The
   * crossline pass collapses with the mainline for the same reason. The two
   * real answers are to give the form variation in the other axis, or to turn
   * the seed raster alone with the `seedDeg` option added below.
