# FIELD NOTES — living learnings

Append-only. Each run's retro adds dated entries: what worked, what failed,
what the human changed, new techniques discovered, sources to consider.
Newest first. Keep entries terse and actionable; promote stable lessons
into the doctrine/library files and prune here.

## 2026-07-08 — framework build (engine smoke test lessons)

- **Grain economics**: full-frame feTurbulence grain rasterizes to a 10-40MB
  incompressible bitmap in the printed PDF. Always `AK.grainTile()` as a
  repeating background. (Encoded in TECHNIQUE_LIBRARY #2 and noise.js docs.)
- **Vector text survives blend modes**: Chromium's print engine keeps HTML/
  SVG text as vector even under mix-blend-mode overlays — but canvas text
  always rasterizes. Text in DOM/SVG, art in canvas. (Engine SKILL.md.)
- **`#map svg { display: block }`** — inline SVG baseline space overflowed
  the page by ~5px; the engine's body_overflow gate caught it. Always
  display:block full-bleed SVGs.
- **AlbersUsa inversion is a trap**: us-atlas TopoJSON is pre-projected and
  the inversion params are not recoverable reliably. We committed genuinely
  unprojected sources instead (Natural Earth 10m state outline via
  world-atlas; plotly unprojected counties for the 29 boroughs). Winding
  must satisfy the d3 spherical convention — rewind any ring whose
  geoArea > π.
- **3D composition must be computed, not eyeballed**: horizonY =
  cy + tan(−pitch)·f; a peak d units above the camera at distance D lands
  (d/D)·f px above the horizon. First two terrain attempts buried the
  range in the bottom 15% of frame. (Math now in ak3d.js header.)
- **Machine QA passed a slide the eye failed** (terrain crammed low, spec
  row colliding with ridge): objective gates catch errors, only pixel
  critics catch composition. Both layers are mandatory.
- **Simultaneous-contrast illusion**: bright strokes bounding a dark region
  make it read lighter than an identical fill elsewhere. Sample pixels
  before declaring a fill bug (we chased a phantom for four bisections).
- **Contrast estimator limits**: qa.py's bbox-median method under-detects
  text over busy varied art. The pixel critic must check worst-case
  contrast visually; the estimator is a tripwire only.

## 2026-07-08 — patterns adopted from the GitHub scout pass

- Instincts ledger (ECC pattern): ledger/instincts.json, confidence-scored
  lessons injected into future runs. Prune < 0.5 confidence after 8 runs.
- Variance dials + anti-repetition (taste-skill pattern): in the dossier
  header + artwork ledger.
- Claims-file fact-checking (Loki shape): claims.json with atomic claims,
  evidence URL + verbatim quote each; slides carry claim-ids.
- Completion gate (planning-with-files pattern): out/<run>/run_state.json
  phases must all be "done" with artifacts existing before merge/delivery.
- Critic text transcription (OCR-wave pattern, no deps): pixel critics
  transcribe every visible word from the PNG and diff against the dossier
  copy — catches font fallback, tofu, truncation that DOM checks miss.
- Candidates parked for later: microsoft/flint-chart (chart spec language),
  pyiqa (BRISQUE gate; heavy torch dep), meodai/heerich (SVG voxel mode),
  self-hosted Postiz (publish automation), pretext (text layout lib).
