"""qa.py — machine QA over rendered slides. The objective half of the review
loop; the subjective half is the pixel-critic agents reading the PNGs.

Checks per slide (consuming render_report.json + the PNGs):
  - PNG exists, exact expected pixel size
  - not blank / not near-uniform (dead render detector)
  - TEXT COLLISIONS: no two text elements' line boxes may overprint
    (FAIL when both are primary text, WARN when either is decorative).
    Added 2026-07-08 after a body-copy-over-bar-label collision passed
    every other gate and had to be caught by the scorer's eyes.
  - BUSY ART UNDER TEXT (WARN only): samples the PNG under each primary text
    line box, masks the glyph ink, and warns when the background carries
    high-contrast structured edges (a canvas/bitmap arc or texture the DOM
    collision gate cannot see). Added 2026-07-10 after canvas flightpath/orbit
    arcs crossed body copy and a headline and machine QA passed both.
  - LABEL CROSSED BY ART (FAIL): samples a thin ring around each non-decorative
    label's glyph ink and FAILS when ink of the GLYPHS' OWN VALUE touches the
    letterforms across the label (a rule, scored outline or groove edge struck
    through the text). Knockout plates and halos leave that ring clean.
    Added 2026-07-25 after four slides shipped art-band labels crossed by
    canvas-drawn geometry through two scoring cycles of PASS with zero warns.
  - TEXT UNDER AN OPAQUE PLATE (FAIL): consumes render.py's occlusion probe
    (paint-order-confirmed intersections of each line box with foreign opaque
    element boxes) and FAILS when a plate covers >=20x6px of a non-decorative
    line box. Added 2026-07-26 after an opaque DEAD plate over the bottom third
    of a subtitle and a note column run under a callout plate produced two
    consecutive hard fails while machine QA reported PASS, 0 fails, 0 warns:
    text_collisions() only compares GLYPH LINE BOXES, and a padded plate's
    background is not one.
  - FRAME BALANCE / DEAD LOWER ZONE (FAIL): compares the bottom third's
    craft-density against the slide's own frame average and FAILS a top-loaded
    composition (<55%). Added 2026-07-26 after the SIXTH consecutive scorer
    note naming "dead lower zones" as the series' artwork-craft ceiling. Every
    earlier gate here judges legibility; nothing measured composition, so the
    only reviewer who saw this was the scorer, at the ship gate, too late to
    rebuild slides -- which is why it became a note six times instead of a fix.
    data-breather on <body> demotes it to WARN (and the dossier gate checks the
    storyboard actually declared that slide a breather).
  - DECLARED CONTACT SHADOW DOES NOT READ (FAIL): opt-in. A slide may name, on
    <body data-contacts>, the region its contact shadow occupies and the ground
    that shadow is supposed to darken; this measures both at feed scale in
    CIELAB and FAILs below 4.0 L* of separation, WARNs below 8.0. Added
    2026-08-05 after run No.26 made the contact corollary its declared attack,
    built the shadow exactly as specified in #1A0F08 at alpha 0.55, laid it on
    a table already near #0B0906 for a 1.2 L* composite, and shipped an object
    four pixel critics said was floating while machine QA reported 0 fails. A
    shadow is a subtraction and needs something to subtract from; nothing here
    had ever asked whether a declared depth cue survived compositing.
  - LEADER LANDS ON NOTHING (FAIL): opt-in. A slide declares each drafting
    leader in window.__akLeaders as {target, at:[x,y], to:[x,y]} -- the feature's
    own coordinates and where the leader ends -- and this FAILs when the two are
    more than LEADER_LAND_PX apart. Added 2026-08-07 after run No.28's slide 06
    shipped two detail-circle leaders pointing at void through two pixel critics,
    a flow critic and the first scoring cycle: their tails were fixed pixel
    deltas from each circle's own centre, so the target was never named anywhere
    and no reviewer could tell a leader reaching something small from one
    reaching nothing. A pixel test cannot answer it (the landing tick puts ink at
    the terminus); declared arithmetic can.
  - UNSEEDED RANDOMNESS (FAIL): consumes render.py's determinism source scan
    and FAILS a slide whose inline script calls Math.random() or the crypto
    random APIs instead of the seeded AK.rng(seed) / AK.reseed(seed) the slide
    contract requires; clock reads (Date.now, new Date(), performance.now) are
    a WARN. Added 2026-08-01 after a stipple field shipped on Math.random()
    through five render rounds on a deck about a public record, caught by a
    human running grep. Every other check here reads one screenshot, so an
    irreproducible slide is invisible to all of them.
  - CANVAS RASTER TEXT (WARN only): warns when a slide draws meaningful text
    (>=4 alphabetic chars) via canvas fillText/strokeText, which ships as a
    bitmap in the vector PDF and is invisible to the ranker/copy_sync/a11y.
    Added 2026-07-19 after S7/S8 canvas labels had to be converted to DOM by hand.
  - approximate contrast of every non-decorative text node vs its local
    background (WCAG-style luminance ratio; estimate, so thresholds are
    conservative: <2.0 on primary text = FAIL, <3.5 = WARN)
  - text nodes inside the safe zone (default 80px margins at 1080x1350;
    slides may bleed decorative art, not primary text)
  - forwards render_report warnings (offscreen/clipped/tiny text, missing
    fonts, console errors)

    Built 2026-07-29 to close the standing artwork-craft weakness (lowest
    criterion in 16 of the first 19 runs) by testing whether a slide's art
    actually carries the argument it claims. Two candidate metrics were
    calibrated against real renders, using that run's own hero as the
    known-bad (the scorer: the column "reads as one uniform amber extrusion",
    its declared steel-below-brass-above material change did not survive) and
    slide 07's sodium-to-slate ownership boundary as the known-good (a turn
    the scorer and the flow critic both called the deck's best fusion beat).

    BOTH METRICS FAILED TO SEPARATE THEM, and in the worst direction:

      known-bad  S03 steel vs brass    dE 49.0  AUC 0.87  visible 58/83 pct
      known-good S07 sodium vs slate   dE 12.2  AUC 0.77  visible 54/53 pct

    Colour separability is HIGHER on the broken encoding than on the working
    one, because the steel really is a different colour where you can see it;
    it just reads as a glassy plinth rather than as half the object. And the
    occlusion fraction is LOWER on the working one, because a deliberate
    composition puts type over its own art. Any threshold drawn through these
    numbers passes the defect and fails the success.

    The real defect is semantic, about shape, proportion and context ("is this

    this function returns numbers for the pixel critics and the scorer to read,

    than guessed, which is a corpus exercise, not a slot at the end of a run.

# defect this gate exists to catch:
#
#   known-bad, the shipped defect    #1A0F08 @ a0.55 over #0B0906 -> dL 1.24
#   known-bad, measured in the final renders of the three slides the scorer
#     still called "floating-adjacent" (S01, S06, S09): the whole ground band
#     below the object varies by 1.6 to 2.0 L* end to end, i.e. no dip at all
#   known-half-good, the mid-run repair (a warm ground pool at #2A2118 under
#     the object, then the same shadow) -> dL 4.3 measured in the reconstruction
#     under out/upgrade-2026-08-05/, and the scorer's verdict on it was
#     "half landed"
#   known-GOOD, measured in the shipped render of slide 04, whose bar-base
#     shadows the scorer and the pixel critics called convincing: dL 8.1 at
#     both bars (shadow L* 81.7 / 82.7 against paper at L* 89.8 / 90.7)
#
# So FAIL below 4.0 sits under everything that has ever read at all and above
# everything that measurably did not, and WARN below 8.0 lands one tenth of an
# L* under the studio's own known-good, which is where a comfort band belongs:
# the half-landed repair warns, the shadow that convinced does not. A JND for
# two large flat patches side by side
# is about 0.4 L*, so 4.0 is an order of magnitude over it: the margin pays
# for the LANCZOS downscale to feed width, the paper tooth and film grain the
# shadow is composited into, and the fact that a blurred shadow has no edge to
# help the eye. Raising these is a tightening and is fine; lowering them is
# the maintainer's call.
# A leader may stop a little short of the feature it points at -- the drafting
# gap is real practice -- but a gap is a few px, not a journey. 24 design px is

    Run No.28's slide 06 shipped two drafting detail circles whose leader lines
    ran out into empty void, through two pixel critics, a flow critic and the
    first scoring cycle. Nobody was careless: a leader stopping in void looks
    exactly like a leader reaching something small, and the tails were authored
    as fixed pixel deltas from each circle's OWN centre
    (tail:[-70,-70,-150,-150]), so there was no place in the slide, the record
    or the pipeline where the target was ever named. There was nothing to check.

    A PIXEL test cannot answer this and was rejected rather than shipped weak:
    the leader's own landing tick puts ink at its terminus, so "is there ink
    where it ends" is always yes, and any corridor-masked variant of it would
    fire on legitimate art. What the machine CAN check is arithmetic the author
    supplies: where the leader ends, and where the feature it enlarges actually
    is. Two points, one distance. This is the same shape as the contact-shadow
    and encoding contracts -- opt-in, declared by the slide, failed only when
    the slide contradicts itself -- and the real work it does is in the
    authoring: you cannot write `at:` without going and finding the target's
    coordinates, which is exactly the step the defect skipped.

    artwork craft at 6-7 for six consecutive runs (ledger entries 10, 11, 13,
    14, 15, 16, 18).

    Added 2026-07-26 after the sixth consecutive scorer note naming the same
    defect. The root cause was never a missing pair of eyes, it was
    DESIGN_DOCTRINE 1's "at least one generous quiet zone per slide": an
    unbounded, unplaced licence that the directors room kept spending on the
    frame's bottom band, because that is the cheapest place to put it. The
    dossier then legitimized the empty bottom, and the pixel critics grade each
    slide against its own dossier, so the only reviewer who ever saw the defect
    was the scorer -- at the ship gate, with no budget left to rebuild slides.
    Every run it therefore became a FIELD_NOTES sentence instead of a fix.

    TWO defects share the name, and separating them is what took this from a
    note to a gate. (1) The bottom band is EMPTY (2026-07-17 S09 and
    2026-07-20 S03 both ship a bottom 40% with nothing in it; neither was ever
    named, which is its own evidence about relying on eyes). (2) The bottom
    band is OCCUPIED BUT FLAT -- grey label plates and hairlines floating on
    bare ground, which is what 2026-07-26's S05 and S08 actually are. A plain
    occupancy measure sees only (1): across the 45 scorer-labeled slides the
    dead ones' whole-frame occupancy (median 0.505) is indistinguishable from
    the rest (0.537), because every slide has quiet margins and a flat plate
    counts as "occupied".

    So a cell only counts when it carries MODELED tone. Box-downsample the PNG
    6x (film grain is high-frequency and would otherwise read as craft
    everywhere), then per 27px design cell take the robust luminance spread and
    peak local gradient (does it hold anything at all) AND the normalized
    entropy of its tonal histogram (is that content modeled or flat). A flat
    plate is bimodal and scores ~0.2; graded, textured, lit or rendered art
    scores 0.7+. Drop the safe-margin ring, then compare the bottom third's
    craft density against the slide's OWN frame average.

    Deliberately RELATIVE. An absolute craft floor was tested and rejected: it
    fails 48-60% of every slide the series has ever shipped, which makes it a
    taste judgment the machine has no business making unilaterally, and the
    doctrine's own position is that flat is a legitimate choice. The ratio
    asks only the question the scorers kept asking, which is whether the slide
    spends its craft up top and coasts. Content spread through the frame
    scores ~1.0 at any density.

    Returns (ratio, bands) or None if unmeasurable.
