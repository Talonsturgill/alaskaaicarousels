"""machine_due.py, is the weekly machine pass due today? Exit 0 = yes, run it. Exit 1 = no.

WHY THIS EXISTS (owner, 2026-10-02)

Until this day every run ended in Phase 12, which spawned the upgrade engineer and made zero to
three changes to the machine from what THAT ONE RUN saw. The owner's words: the daily automation
should "only fix like the things that were broken during the run", and once a week a run should
spend time "addressing the things that really need to be fixed based on the recurring themes that
it saw during the week. So that it can be constantly making upgrades each week based on actual
output." One run is one sample. A defect the judges name on four decks in a week is a defect in
the machine, and one they name once may be that deck's.

So a run now fixes what broke in it and QUEUES the rest in `knowledge/MACHINE_QUEUE.md`, and the
weekly pass reads the whole week (`scripts/week_digest.py`) and works the themes that recurred.

THE PASS IS DUE WHEN
  no pass has ever run, or
  the last one was DAYS or more days ago, or
  an open queue item has bitten two or more runs beyond the one that found it, and the last pass
  was not today, because a repeat offender waiting a week is a week of decks paying for it.

It is due on schedule even with an empty queue, because the themes come from the week's own score
reports and flow reviews and not only from what a run remembered to queue.
